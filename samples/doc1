As a feedback-seeker (whether you’re a new engineer or an experienced hand), the more clear you can be about what you’re looking for, the more likely you are to get it. I once sat down for a one-on-one with my manager to discuss an incident, and said, “My agenda for this meeting is how it happened, what our plan for remediation is, and my feelings.” For my manager and me, this worked great. Being clear about what you want also helps you determine whom to ask for it – different problems might go to your direct manager, a more senior engineer, someone who joined the company at the same time you did, or a friend outside of work.
