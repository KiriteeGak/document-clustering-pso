As a manager, mentor, or senior colleague, the best thing you can do is understand what kind of feedback is being requested. You don’t want to tell someone seeking strategic feedback, “Don’t worry! Everything’s great!” Similarly, you don’t want to give a list of ten areas for improvement to someone who’s already being too hard on themselves. What kind of feedback is being sought isn’t always obvious, and probably requires some follow-up questions.
