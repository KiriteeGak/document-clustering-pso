Recovering from an injury like this requires a lot of determination and a lot of help. I’m grateful to have been able to temporarily use all of the lazy-techie apps (groceries, laundry, ridesharing, etc. etc.). But there aren’t apps for everything, and I’m incredibly thankful for the many friends and family who helped with this process, from bringing me crutches when I first broke the knee, coming over with dinner, or keeping me company and taking out the trash on the way out
